          At Love Transfusion, Inc. we believe in the power of human
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love Transfusion provides simple, safe and effective ways for people
          to communicate support and encouragement to those who are hurting –
          whether they be family, friend or even a complete stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time in history, because of the Internet and mobile
          devices, we now have the ability to instantaneously connect those who
          hurt with those who care. Clinical studies have shown that individuals
          who know they are being thought of and prayed for – heal faster,
          better and stronger. When actual visits in person are not logistically
          possible for whatever reason, just the knowledge of a connection with
          someone, regardless of distance… provides a tremendous source of
          comfort.
